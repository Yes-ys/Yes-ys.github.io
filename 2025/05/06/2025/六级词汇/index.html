<li>Option、choice choose 观点选择型</li>

<p>第一个段落（3句话）：<br>    1-2句话，提出问题；<br>    3过渡；<br>第二个段落（6句话）：<br>    3个论点+论据<br>第三个段落（2句话）：<br>    1句话，重申观点；<br>    第2句话，提出期望（万能结尾）；</p>
<h4 id="第一段"><a href="#第一段" class="headerlink" title="第一段"></a>第一段</h4><p>第一句话通常有两种情况；<br>第一句话主要是用来阐释写作讨论问题的背景；</p>
<ol>
<li>题目要求copy the sentence（直接把这句话抄在开头即可）</li>
<li>With respect to（名词或者句子）,opinions are sharply divided, but what is widely acknowledged is that 句子<br> 注意：<br> 1）with respect to后面如果是句子：要使用连词，例如whether College Chinese should be a compulsory course<br> 2）主语从句what is acknowledged is that后面的句子，主要是对前面提到的名词或句子，进一步的“客观”阐释；<br>     eg：it is irreplaceable to cultivate our mind and strengthed the culture confidence of us.</li>

<p>Concerning（名词或句子）,It is a deeply <strong>contentious</strong> issue, but there is a <strong>prevailing consensus</strong> that 句子</p>
<p>第二句话用来表明自己的观点，常见可以有以下写法</p>

<p>论点1：<br>    To start with, as is widely argeed, 句子（非限制性定语从句）</p>
<p><strong>by Yesys</strong><br>The first and foremost argument <strong>rests on</strong> the widely accepted view that </p>
<p>论据1：<br>    It is a fundmental conviction that 句子（形式主语+主语从句）</p>
<p><strong>by Yesys</strong><br>It is an <strong>established truth</strong> that…</p>
<p>论点2：<br>    what’s more, equally important is the enduring truth that 句子（同位语从句+表语倒装）</p>
<p><strong>by Yesys</strong><br>Beyond that, of no less significance is the widely acknowledged reality that…</p>
<p>论据2：<br>    To put it simply, A and B are two sides of the same coin; one is incomplete without the other.（谚语）</p>
<p><strong>by Yesys</strong><br>Fundamentally, A and B enjoy a <strong>symbiotic relationship</strong>; the <strong>vitality</strong> of “A or B” is <strong>fundamentally contingent upon</strong> the <strong>presence</strong> of the other.<br>（共生关系）（活力）（从根本上取决于）（存在）</p>
<p>论点3：<br>    Last and certainly not least, we must shine a spotlight on 名词, a factor whose value has been consistenly undervalued througout history.</p>
<p><strong>by Yesys</strong><br>Ultimately, we must bring into sharp focus [核心名词], a factor that has been historically overlooked yet is fundamental to [相关领域].</p>
<p>论据3：<br>    Therefore, urgent steps must be taken to 动词原形（被动语态）</p>
<p><strong>by Yesys</strong><br>Hence, <strong>concerted</strong> and immediate measures must be <strong>implemented</strong> to [动词原形]…<br>（具体的）（实施）</p>
<h4 id="第三段"><a href="#第三段" class="headerlink" title="第三段"></a>第三段</h4><p>第一句话（再次对我们对观点进行阐释）<br>    In conclusion, while 主题词 has its imperfections, its positive effects far outweight the negative ones, provided that we use it rationally.（让步状语从句+条件状语从句）</p>
<p><strong>by Yesys</strong><br>In summary, while [主题] is not without its limitations, its <strong>net benefits remain substantial</strong>, <strong>contingent upon</strong> its <strong>judicious</strong> application.<br>（净收益）（取决于）（明智的）</p>
<p>第二句话（表达期望&#x2F;号召）<br>    The quicker we are when 句子, the less&#x2F;more 句子</p>
<p><strong>by Yesys</strong><br>The more <strong>proactively</strong> we act to [动词不定式], the greater the <strong>dividend</strong> we <strong>stand to reap</strong> in terms of [积极结果].<br>（积极主动）（红利）（收获）</p>
